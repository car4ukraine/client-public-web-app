Even though a donated car significantly saves costs per car to be ready for the frontline, some costs still have to be covered. <br><br>They include: repairing and installing armor (largest part), adding machine gun turret, painting and delivering to the frontline. This all requires extra 1,500 - 2,500 USD per car. With this fundraiser we'll cover the cost for 8 cars every month donated by fellas from EU and UK. Also if you have a car to donate, please click Donate Car at the home page or use this link car4ukraine.com/donate-car`
